# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to predict customer churn in the telecom industry using machine learning techniques. By identifying customers likely to terminate their service, telecom companies can proactively implement retention strategies.

## Problem Statement

Customer churn is a critical issue in the telecom sector, directly impacting revenue. This project develops a machine learning model to predict which customers are at risk of churning, allowing for targeted retention efforts.

## Solution Approach

Our solution employs machine learning to analyze past data and identify patterns associated with churn. The project follows these key steps:

1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Exploratory data analysis
3. Feature selection and engineering
4. Model selection, training, and evaluation

## Dataset

### Source
We use the "Telecom Churn Dataset" from Kaggle:
[Telco Customer Churn Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)

### Features
The dataset includes various customer attributes:
- Demographics: gender, senior citizenship status, partner and dependent status
- Account information: tenure, contract type, payment method
- Service details: phone and internet service specifics
- Target variable: Churn (whether the customer left the service)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for exploration)
- Required libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Telecom-Customer-Churn-Prediction.git
   ```
2. Install required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run data preprocessing:
   ```
   python preprocess.py
   ```
2. Perform exploratory data analysis:
   ```
   python eda.py
   ```
3. Train and evaluate the model:
   ```
   python model.py
   ```
